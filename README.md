# Project settings

After you checked out the project, you need to open src/test/java package. 
You will find there the SeleniumTest class.

All what you need is already at the project. 
(Webdriver Manager will take care about webdriver binaries and will set path to it. 
Attentions: by default Webdriver Manager downloads the webdriver for the latest chrome version ) 


You just need  to write some code and solve the task.
