# Where do I find tasks?

After you checked out the project, you need to open src/test/java package. 
You will see teh SeleniumTest class there.

All what you need is already at the project. 
(Webdriver manager will take care about webdriver binaries and will set path to it) 


You need just to write some code and solve the task.
